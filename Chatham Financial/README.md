This folder contains the one coding challenge that was needed for my application to Chatham Financial as a Software Engineer. The challenge and code were completed on coderbyte.com and the challenge was labeled "Simple Password". The first file "Simple Password Description" is the description, conditions, and parameters I was given to complete this challenge. The second file "Simple Password Output" is the test output I was provided when running my test cases. The final file "SimplePassword.js" is the JavaScript file I wrote to complete the challenge. It includes all comments and code that were submitted.
